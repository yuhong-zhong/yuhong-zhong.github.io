Hello! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Columbia University][1] advised by [Asaf Cidon][2].
I am broadly interested in computer systems, especially storage systems, eBPF, memory tiering, and CXL.
Before starting my Ph.D., I was a software engineer at [VMware][3] in the vSAN group working on vSAN Express Storage Architecture and SplinterDB.
I received my master's degree at [Columbia University][1] and my bachelor’s degree at [Harbin Institute of Technology][4].
